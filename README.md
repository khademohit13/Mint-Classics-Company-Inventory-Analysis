## Key Findings
1. The most stocked product lines are "Classic Cars" and "Vintage Cars," while "Trains" and "Ships" are the least stocked.
2. Top-selling products include "1992 Ferrari 360 Spider red," "1937 Lincoln Berline," and "American Airlines: MD-11S."
3. Several products have had no recent sales, which may indicate that they are candidates for reevaluation.
4. Warehouse East has significantly exceeded its capacity, suggesting a need for reorganization or expansion.
